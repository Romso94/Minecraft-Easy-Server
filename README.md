<p align='center' id="description">An easy tool to build Minecraft servers more easily</p>

---

<h3>Why ❓</h3>

Creating a Minecraft server isn't quite easy. It can also be boring because you have to download files, edit .bat files, and perform some wizardry to set up the server. Now, it will be super easy.

<h2>Project Screenshots:</h2>

<h2>How does it work? 👓</h2>
<p>1. Choose your server version from 1.17.1 to 1.21, your folder name, and the amount of RAM you want to allocate.</p>
<p>2. Click on the button.</p>
<p>3. Your server will be generated in a folder on your desktop.</p>

<p>Note that to restart your server go to the folder created and run the file "run.bat"</p>

<h2>🛠️ Installation Steps:</h2>
